# Titanic-Dataset-EDA-Task

# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project performs EDA on the Titanic dataset to find patterns, trends, and relationships between different features like survival, age, gender, travel class, etc.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning (Handling Missing Values)
2. Univariate Analysis (Histograms)
3. Bivariate Analysis (Survival count vs Gender)
4. Correlation Analysis (Heatmap)
5. Pairplot Visualization
6. Summary of Findings

## Key Insights
- Females had higher survival chances.
- 1st class passengers survived more than 3rd class.
- Fare and survival had a positive relation.
- Most passengers were young adults (20-40 years).
